Add dimensions: 

 For instance, if you imagine an xy plane then the augmented tree is for telling you if plane defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10). The augmented tree can tell you if that plane overlaps with a plane defined by (-5, -5) and (5, 5) (true in this case). You can also check intersections against a point by constructing a range of encompassed solely if a single point.
